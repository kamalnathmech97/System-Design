Minimize Critical Resources:
Reduce the number and size of CSS and JavaScript files. This can be achieved by minifying files, 
eliminating unnecessary resources, and using tools like Webpack to bundle assets efficiently.

Defer Non-Critical Resources:
Use the async and defer attributes for non-critical JavaScript. This allows the browser to continue parsing the HTML 
and constructing the DOM while the scripts are being downloaded.

Inline Critical CSS:
Inline the CSS required for the above-the-fold content directly in the HTML document. This reduces the time 
needed to construct the CSSOM.

Lazy Loading:
Defer loading images and other non-essential resources until they are needed, improving the initial load time.

Reduce Render-Blocking Resources:
Ensure that the critical resources needed to render the initial view of the page are loaded as quickly as possible. 
Move non-critical CSS and JavaScript out of the critical path.
