1. Requirements:
Functional: User registration, profile management, posting updates, liking posts, commenting.
Non-Functional: High availability, scalability, security.

2. Architecture:
Microservices: Separate services for user management, posts, comments, likes, etc.

3. Components:
Frontend: React.js application.
Backend: Node.js with Express for API, separate microservices.
Database: MongoDB for user data and posts, Redis for caching.

4. Data Modeling:
Users Collection: UserID, username, password (hashed), email, profile info.
Posts Collection: PostID, UserID, content, timestamp, likes.
Comments Collection: CommentID, PostID, UserID, content, timestamp.

5. High-Level Design:
System Architecture Diagram: Users interact with the frontend, which communicates with backend APIs.
Component Diagram: Separate services for user management, posts, comments, likes.

6. Detailed Design:
API Design: Define endpoints for creating posts, liking posts, etc.
Class Design: Define classes for users, posts, comments in the backend.

7. Scalability and Performance:
Load Balancing: Use Nginx to distribute traffic.
Caching: Use Redis to cache frequently accessed data.

8. Security:
Authentication: JWT-based authentication.
Encryption: Use HTTPS and encrypt sensitive data.

9. Monitoring and Maintenance:
Logging: Use Winston for logging in Node.js.
Monitoring: Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring system metrics.
Alerting: Set up alerts for high error rates or latency.

10. Testing:
Unit Testing: Jest for unit tests in the Node.js application.
Integration Testing: Test the interaction between different services.
Load Testing: Use JMeter to simulate high load scenarios.
