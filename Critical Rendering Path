The Critical Rendering Path is the sequence of steps the browser goes through to convert the HTML, CSS, 
and JavaScript into pixels on the screen.

Document Object Model (DOM) Construction:
The browser parses the HTML to construct the DOM tree, which represents the document's structure and content.

CSS Object Model (CSSOM) Construction:
Simultaneously, the browser parses the CSS files to construct the CSSOM tree, which represents the styles 
applied to the document.

Render Tree Construction:
The browser combines the DOM and CSSOM trees to create the render tree. The render tree contains only the 
nodes required to render the content on the screen, including styling information.

Layout (Reflow):

The browser calculates the position and size of each node in the render tree. 
This step is known as layout or reflow. It determines the exact placement of elements on the page.

Painting:
The browser paints the render tree to the screen, converting the nodes into actual pixels.
