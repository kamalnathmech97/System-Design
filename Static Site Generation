Static Site Generation (SSG)
Short Summary:

Generates all pages at build time.
Produces static HTML files for fast serving.
Details:

Pros:
Performance: Fast load times due to pre-built static files.
Security: Reduced attack surface as no server-side processing is involved.
Cost: Cheaper hosting since static files can be served from CDNs.

Cons:
Build Time: Long build times for large sites.
Content Freshness: Requires full rebuilds for content updates.
Scalability: Frequent updates can make build times impractical.

Ideal Use Cases:
Sites with infrequent updates.
Marketing pages, documentation sites.
Projects needing fast initial loads and low maintenance.

Tools:
Next.js
Gatsby
Jekyll

Allows static pages to be incrementally regenerated after the initial build.
Combines static generation with on-demand updates.
Details:

Pros:

Hybrid Performance: Mixes the speed of SSG with SSR's flexibility.
Content Freshness: Pages update at specified intervals without full rebuilds.
Scalability: Efficiently handles frequent updates.

Cons:

Complexity: More setup and management required.
Cache Invalidation: Managing and updating stale content is challenging.
Server Requirements: Needs some server-side logic for page regeneration.
